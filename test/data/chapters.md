## Certain Suggestive Points
    
## The Grease Spot on a Hungarian Passport
    
Under pressure from Poirot, the Countess confirms that she is Helena Goldenberg and therefore had motive, but insists she is not the killer.

## The Christian Name of Princess Dragomiroff

Poirot confronts Arbuthnot with a guess that Mary Debenham was the Countess’s governess. Arbuthnot silence confirms to Poirot that he is correct.
    
    
## The Identity of Mary Debenham
    
Poirot sends for Mary Debenham, and suggests to her that she was living with the Armstrongs when Daisy was murdered. Mary admits this is true and that she previously lied.
    
    
Arbuthnot becomes defensive of Mary, and threatens Poirot with injury, before they both leave, denying Mary had any involvement in Ratchett’s murder.
    
    
## Further Surprising Revelations
    
Poirot calls for Foscarelli and correctly guesses that he acted as the Armstrong’s chauffer.
    
    
Poirot calls for Greta Ohlsson, and she admits she was Daisy Armstrong’s nurse.
    
    
The Valet comes forward to admit he was Colonel Armstrong’s assistant in the war, and apologises for his earlier deceipt.
    
    
Poirot questions Hardman’s history with the Armstrongs, but he denies any connection.
    
    
## Poirot Propounds Two Solutions
    
In front of the assembled passengers, Poirot announces he has two theories of the crime, and will leave it to M. Bouc and Dr Constantine to “judge" which is correct.
    
    
Poirot covers the known facts of the case, including the time of murder and that it was believed no one had departed the train.
    
    
Poirot proposes one possible theory, involving an unknown assailant who snuck onto the train, murdered Ratchett, discarded the uniform in Hildegarde’s luggage and left the train
    
    
M. Bouc and Dr Constantine express shock and doubt at this theory, given it runs contrary to much of the evidence and theories they have seen earlier
    
    
Poirot then proposes a second possible theory, that all of the passengers colluded and participated in the murder to exact justice against Ratchett.
    
    
Poirot concludes the smashed watch was set to a fake time, and that MacQueen had lied about Ratchett not speaking French to make Poirot think Ratchett was dead at 12:37am, whereas the true murder occurred closer to 2:00am.
    
    
Poirot concludes the threatening letters, unknown assailant, conductor’s uniform and red dressing gown were all decoys designed to confuse the investigation.
    
    
Poirot determines that of the 13 guests who delivered 12 stab wounds, it was the Countess that did not take part, as she was the person with the greatest motive and her husband instead took her place.
    
    
Poirot concludes that Linda Arden, Daisy’s grandmother, was the mastermind behind her plan, at which point Mrs Hubbard announces herself as Linda.
    
    
Linda Arden confirms many details of Poirot’s theory, and confirms the remaining connections between the passengers and the Armstrong family. She insists it was an act of justice and not revenge.
    
    
Finally understanding why Poirot outlined his first potential solution, M. Bouc and Dr Constantine agree to go along with Poirot’s conspiracy, and present the decoy solution to police after all.
